House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

Project Summary:

In this project, we built a Linear Regression model from scratch using scikit-learn to predict house prices based on different features.
The goal was to practice core regression modeling, evaluate using appropriate metrics, interpret model results, and understand important assumptions of Linear Regression.

1. Dataset Import and Preprocessing
Loaded the House Price Prediction dataset (CSV format).

Handled missing values and cleaned the dataset if necessary.

Performed basic feature selection.

Scaled/normalized features if required.

2. Train-Test Split
Divided the data into Training (80%) and Testing (20%) sets using train_test_split from scikit-learn.

3. Model Training
Used sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression to fit a model on the training data.

Trained the model to learn the relationship between independent variables (e.g., Area, Bedrooms) and the target variable (Price).

4. Model Evaluation
Predicted house prices on the test set.

Evaluated the model using:

MAE (Mean Absolute Error)

MSE (Mean Squared Error)

RÂ² Score (Coefficient of Determination)

5. Visualization and Interpretation
Plotted the regression line (in case of single feature).

Visualized actual vs predicted prices using scatter plots.

Analyzed residuals to check model behavior.

Interpreted coefficients to understand feature importance (i.e., how much each feature contributes to price prediction).

ðŸ“Š Evaluation Metrics and Results

Metric	Purpose	Comments
MAE	Average magnitude of errors	Lower is better
MSE	Penalizes larger errors more than MAE	Lower is better
RÂ² Score	% of variance explained by model	Closer to 1 is better
ðŸ“š Key Learnings
Linear Regression Assumptions:

Linearity between independent and dependent variables.

No multicollinearity among features.

Residuals should be normally distributed and homoscedastic.

Interpretation of Coefficients:

Each coefficient shows the expected change in the target variable for a one-unit change in the feature.

Evaluation Metrics:

MAE gives the average error.

MSE penalizes larger errors more.

RÂ² shows how well the model explains the variability of the outcome.

Multicollinearity Detection:

High correlation between input features was checked using correlation matrices.

Violation of Assumptions:

May lead to biased or inefficient predictions.
